running and building this should be easy, just go onto o
ne of the dcXX dockers and navigate to the directory you
placed it at and run ./buildSyncGhs.sh

running it is also easy, do ./launcher.sh as detailed in the misc scripts
just make sure to use the launcher script that came with this project, i modified it

This program takes about 2 minutes to fully build the MST with the config in this zipped file
just FYI
